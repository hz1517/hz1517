### This article introduces the hardware structure and software and hardware design methods of the multifunctional electronic calendar based on the EasyPic Pro v7 board microcomputer. The design is composed of four modules: data display module, temperature acquisition module, time processing module and adjustment setting module. The system uses the EasyPic Pro v7 board microcomputer as the controller, and uses the serial clock calendar chip DS1302 to record the calendar and time. It can time the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second, and has multiple functions such as leap year compensation. Temperature acquisition uses DS18B20 chip, perpetual calendar uses intuitive digital display, data display uses Mikroe-55 2x16 LCD display module, which can simultaneously display year, month, day, week, hour, minute, and second on LCD1602, and has functions such as time calibration. This perpetual calendar has many advantages such as easy reading, intuitive display, diverse functions, simple circuit, low cost, etc., and has broad market prospects.
